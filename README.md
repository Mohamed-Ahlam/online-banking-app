# online-banking-app

Built an online banking app by first building and using Java objects and then later on added the online servlet component with authentication and web components. 

Requirments to this building this project:

Create Java objects to contain:

Banking users with usernames and unique identifiers
3 different types of accounts that can be added to the banking userâ€™s object/profile (keeping in mind that a user could have more than one of the same type of account, like 2 savings accounts) that can hold funds as dollars and cents.

Methods:
View account history
View account balances
Sum all balances
Transfer funds between accounts (also not allowing a user to transfer more from an account than they have in the account)
Add accounts (must have a type and a name)
Remove accounts (must have no funds in them at the time)
Logging to show transaction state (could be used for account history)
Think about how you want to store logging data, could be per user or could be mapped using a java.util Class to hold in a RandomAccessFile, or a logfile per user.

Maintaining state in a Java File:

Storing objects in a Java File
Once a transaction is complete, write new object to file
Used on startup (NOTE: ADD INITIALIZE METHOD) to bring records into memory
